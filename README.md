# clean-genes overview

## Project goal
To automatically clean up a gene alignment by trimming to open reading frame (ORF) and identifying and/or removing problematic sequences. Basically an alignment normalization tool that expects genes as inputs and could have specific value for Influenza genes. This is intended to be a Rust crate designed to do a lot of work as quickly as possible.

## Project title
current proposal: clean-genes

Justification:
1. The name is available as a software in general and as a Rust crate on crates.io
2. Cleaning is what the software does
3. Genes are the expected input

## Motivation

I have done this work more/less manually before and it takes a lot of time, is hard to explain, and is very susceptible to human error. Where I did this work a lot was when I started working with influenza at USDA-ARS. Because influenza genomes are small and a deep study can involve a great number of viruses this work was frequently necessary

## Project plan

I intend to build the software in a modular fashion such that it can:
1. Be built in smaller pieces to demonstrate value iteratively
2. Be utilized by people with different needs from what I'm familiar with
3. Run more efficiently when the user does not want or need all available functionality

### Potential modules
- ORF trimming: Determines the reading frame based on stop-codon frequency and conservation. Optionally trims the sequence using these determined reading frames
- Frameshift ID: Identifies sequences with frameshift mutations based on stop-codon frequency and conservation. Optionally removes these sequences and prompts the user to re-align and run this software again.
- Poor Quality Filter: Identifies sequences with an abundance of missing data, overly short length, or significant gaps. Optionally removes these sequences
- Taxonomic Outlier ID: Identifies sequences that don't belong in the alignment taxonomically. Could potentially use GC content, k-mers, and/or sequence similarity. I am resistant to using reference sequences for this, but it's not impossible. Optionally removes these sequences.
- Codon Optimized ID: Identifies codon-optimized sequences like those created for vaccines based on codon distribution in the alignment and/or an understanding of what a normal codon distribution is. Optionally removes these sequences.
- Gap Groups: Identifies groups of sequences with shared indel patterns. Also identifies outliers. Optionally outputs these sequences in seperate fasta files excluding the common gaps. 

When used together, the removal steps are no longer optional. For ID-only the modules must be run one-at-a-time.

Alignment would likely be done in MAFFT. MAFFT is fairly fast and produces high-quality results consistently using defualt parameters.

### Phase 1
Build the basic user-interface and the ORF trimming module.

### Timeline
The time required for software development is very hard to predict. Things like VCM, holidays, unforseen challenges, and conferences would delay the schedule. Given that I am not solely focused on this project and it is holiday season I believe I can complete Phase 1 by the end of December. Optimization for performance may or may not be done before Phase 2, but correctness will be ensured. 

Phase 2 will likely be a little harder than Phase 1 due to multiple tasks being completed in 1 module as well as integration of alignment and could take a couple of months.

Phase 3 should be similar in complexity to Phase 1 taking about a month.

Phase 4 is seems like a bit of a harder problem and could take a couple of months.

Phases 5 and 6 will be very challenging and I am hesitant to put a timeline on them at all.

Unit tests, Regression tests, benchmarking, and fuzzing will all be used to ensure correctness and maximize performance.

Between each phase I intend to discuss my progress with my supervisor Brian Lee, my Rust mentor Sam Shepard, and other interested colleauges including Allen Kim who has previously expressed interest in contributing to this project.
